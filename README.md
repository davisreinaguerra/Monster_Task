# Open Source Monster Task Apparatus

The assessment of ethologically relevant foraging behaviors requires behavioral experiments which simultaneously offer rewards and introduce threats.  The Monster Task developed by Tsutsui-Kimura et al., (2022) is an open-top rectangular box with two chambers: a “nest” chamber which is kept under low illumination to mimic an environmental shelter, and a foraging chamber under high illumination to mimic a daytime foraging situation which requires the mouse leaves its shelter (figure 3). On the far side of the foraging chamber is a mock predator (“Monster”) attached to a motor and positioned behind a reward port which extends upwards from the floor to deliver a pre-set aliquot of water after a fixed number of licks. To get to the reward port, the mice must cross a threshold which is monitored by an infrared break-beam sensor, the crossing of which triggers rapid back and forth movement of the Monster, and a loud complex sound produced by an overhead speaker.    

Presented here is an open source version of the Monster Task based on the Arduino Uno Microcontroller.
