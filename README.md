# Monster-Box---Arduino-Version-1

### The Monster Box was originally created by the Watabe-Uchida Lab by Iku Kimura and Brett Graham (Tsutsui-Kimura et al., 2022)

## Introduction

### This is a detailed guide to building the Monster Box Using Arduino rather than Teensy as a microcontroller.  Although Teensy has certain advantages, Arduino is capable of running the same operations, and is more accessible to those who have limited engineering experience.  The Arduino Uno is one of the most common development boards, and are usually easy to get a hold of.
