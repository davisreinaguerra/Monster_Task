# Monster-Box (Arduino Version 1)

### The Monster Box was originally created by the Watabe-Uchida Lab by Iku Kimura and Brett Graham (Tsutsui-Kimura et al., 2022)

## Introduction

### This is a detailed guide to building the Monster Box Using Arduino rather than Teensy as a microcontroller.  Although Teensy has certain advantages, Arduino is capable of running the same operations, and is more accessible to those who have limited engineering experience.  The Arduino Uno is one of the most common development boards, and is usually easy to get a hold of.

### Other changes from past versions of the task include: 1) lighter "monster" allowing for the use of a smaller arduino compatible motor instead of the large teknic motor used in the past.  2) The use of stackable arduino shields in the place of certain breakout boards that were not easily compatible with teensy.  3) Two speakers on either side of the "monster" side of the cage.
