## Development Board/Microcontroller

### This project is based on the Arduino UNO development board and microcontroller.  As of 7/25/22 the Arduino Uno Rev3 (R3) is the one on the market: https://a.co/d/eRG5K8r.  This can be purchased from a variety of sources and has many compatible variants

## Shields

### This project makes the use of shields, breakout boards designed for arduino uno that can be stacked atop the arduino/
### Adafruit 16 Channel 12 bit PWM Servo Shield
### Adafruit MusicMaker MP3 Shield (contains an onboard stereo amplifier)

### This project also uses a couple of other breakout boards

### Sparkfun capacative sensors
